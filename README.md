# Isogrid Binary STL generator

Generates a binary STL of a defined isogrid structure. You can then import this STL into your CAD software.

I use [https://3dviewer.net/](https://3dviewer.net/) to view the output file.

The python sources are in the folder `src`. The stl files generated are in the `output` folder.
